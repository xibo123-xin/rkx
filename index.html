    <h3>Research on Classification of Information Frames in Gastric Endoscopy Videos and Classification of Electric Dye Frames and White Light Frames</h3>
    <p><strong>Participant:</strong> Kaixin Ren</p>
    <p><strong>Project Dates:</strong> January 2025 - present</p>
    <p><strong>Research Areas:</strong> Gastric endoscopy video analysis; information frame classification; electric dye frame classification; white light frame classification; early gastric cancer detection</p>
    <p><strong>Project Description:</strong> This project focuses on the classification of information frames in gastric endoscopy videos, specifically aiming at distinguishing between electric dye frames and white light frames. By leveraging advanced image processing and machine learning algorithms, the project aims to accurately identify and categorize different types of frames in gastric endoscopy videos. This classification is crucial for extracting valuable information that can assist in the early detection of gastric cancer. Through in-depth analysis of the characteristics of electric dye frames and white light frames, the research team develops effective classification models, which not only improve the efficiency of gastric endoscopy video analysis but also provide important technical support for the early diagnosis and treatment of gastric cancer, ultimately contributing to improving the prognosis of patients with gastric cancer.</p>
